I worked with ERPs. Later, I developed mobile applications, and then I worked on websites and front-end. However, I found my spark when I started working on machine learning. \n\nWhen I took my first machine learning course in 2018, I knew this is what I wanted to do for my career. Therefore, before even finishing my software engineering degree, I started my master's. My first research experience was about voice activity detection, and I collaborated on a publication at Interspeech.
